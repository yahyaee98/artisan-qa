#Q/A app made with Laravel and the Artisan Console
The purpose of the exercise is to see how comfortable you are with a Laravel based interactive console app. We have done a bit of work for you. If you fork this project, and run `php artisan qanda:interactive`, the command will be started. In this command, create an event loop and implement the following features:

- The initial interaction should allow you to choose between adding questions and answers and viewing previously entered answers.

### Creating Questions
- Upon choosing the option to add a question, the user will be prompted to give a question and the answer to that question.
- Upon giving a question and answer, this must be stored in the database. Use migrations to create the DB tables.

### Practising Questions
- Upon choosing to view the questions, the user will be prompted to choose from the previously given questions which one he wants to practice.
- Upon choosing to practice a question, the user must fill in the right answer for the question, which will be checked against the previously given answer.
- Upon answering a question, the user is returned to the list of all questions, and sees his progress for each question.
- Upon completing all questions, an overview of the users final progress is given.

### Extra
- Every step must have an option to go back one step.
- Use the DB, and use laravel best practices to approach it.
- Allow the user to exit the interactive console with an option at every point.

### I really want this job
- Make a new console command to be run with `php artisan qanda:reset` that removes all previous progresses.
- Write unit tests.
